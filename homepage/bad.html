            I'm a fourth year Computing Science undergraduate at the University of Alberta with plans to complete at least a MSc after graduation.
            I have interests in video game design, compiler design and optimization, as well as artificial intelligence.
            My picture suggests otherwise, but I have very long hair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some interesting tidbits about me include:
          </p>
          <ul class="aboutMeList">
            <li>
              There is a small patch of white hair on my head that my friends claim marks me as a wizard
            </li>
            <li>
              I have a fraternal twin brother named Landon, and two sisters: Madison and Payton
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Clearly my parents have a fascination with names that end in "-on". My real name is secretly Braedon.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              I did an internship at IBM in Markham, Ontario.
            </li>
            <li>
              All of my closest friends are graduating this year and I am not. It's a sad time.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have pierced nipples (my ex made me do it)
            </li>
            <li>
              My friends like to call me &#x1f35e;.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I am an active member of two clubs at the University. The Video Game Art &amp; Design club (VGAD) and the Undergraduate Association of Computing Science (UACS).
            Both of these clubs have taught me valuable skills that I will use later in life. I've been refereeing hockey for years. I once got a puck to the face which caused me to lose two teeth (they got replaced).
          </p>
          <p>
            I like programming jokes and browsing the internet. If I realize I don't know something, I immediately google it so I can learn everything about it. I now know a little bit of everything.
            I am very good at math and my friends say I have a bad taste in anime. I like to help people solve problems, so I'm often the person people in UACS turn to.

                  PL/X is an internal language for Z-Systems. It's a very low level language meant to replace assembly on Z-Systems.
                  Testing involved investigating failing functional tests and creating reports for the development teams to fix.

                  I became familiar with IBM Z-System mainframes while developing a backend for LLVM.
                  This also meant learning a new object file format (GOFF) and dealing with the intricacies of legacy corporate production code.

            By hiring me, employers would get a driven worker and learner.
            I am an adept listener and team player willing to discus and design new and innovative solutions to problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also bring a strong set of technical skills to any team. I have a strong mastery of C++ and Python. My experience at IBM has lent me a depth of understanding
            when it comes to low-level system concepts. My acadmeic aspirations also drive me to continue to improve and gain new knowledge to provide evolving solutions
            to a variety of problems.
